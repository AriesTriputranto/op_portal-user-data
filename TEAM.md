# HTML Standard Team Instructions

This document contains info used by the team maintaining the standard. Mostly boring infrastructure stuff.

## Handling pull requests

The green button shall not be pushed. Each change needs to result in a single commit on the master branch, with no merge commits.

For optimal merges, the following instructions may be helpful:

### Merging pull requests from forks

Pull requests from external contributors come from their forks. Here is a Bash function that you can add to your `.bash_profile` or similar that makes it easy to merge such PRs:

```bash
pr () {
  git fetch origin refs/pull/$1/head:refs/remotes/origin/pr/$1 --force
  git checkout -b pr/$1 origin/pr/$1
  git rebase master
  git checkout master
  git merge pr/$1 --ff-only
}

$ pr 123
```

It will pull down the PR into a local branch, using [the special refs GitHub provides](https://help.github.com/articles/checking-out-pull-requests-locally/). Then it will rebase the PR's commits on top of `master`, and do a fast-forward only merge into `master`. At that point you can do `git push origin master` to push the changes, and comment on the pull request with something like "Merged as 123deadb33f" before closing.

### Merging pull requests from branches

Pull requests from other editors or members of the WHATWG GitHub organization may come from branches within this repository. Here is a function that you can use to merge such PRs:

```bash
mypr () {
  git checkout $1
  git rebase master
  git push origin $1 --force
  git checkout master
  git merge $1 --ff-only
}

$ mypr branch-name
```

It will rebase the PR on top of `master`, then force-push it to the appropriate branch, thus updating the PR. Then it will do the fast-forward only merge into `master`. At this point you can do a `git push origin master` to push the changes, which will _automatically_ close the PR and mark it as merged, since you managed to update the commits contained there.
